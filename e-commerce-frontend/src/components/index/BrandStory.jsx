                    Founded in 2020, BR.F emerged from a simple belief: fashion should be both forward-thinking and responsible. We combine cutting-edge design with sustainable practices to create clothing that doesn't just look goodâ€”it does good.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Every piece is thoughtfully crafted using eco-friendly materials and ethical manufacturing processes. We're not just creating clothes; we're building a movement toward a more conscious future in fashion.
